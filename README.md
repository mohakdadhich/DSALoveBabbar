# DSA Learning Repository

Welcome to my DSA learning repository! I'm Mohak Dadhich, and I embarked on this journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through the Supreme Batch by LOVE Babbar Bhaiya.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the code and resources I accumulated during the duration of the course. Throughout the journey, I delved into various topics essential for understanding and implementing efficient algorithms. Here's a glimpse of what I covered during the course:

- **FlowChart & PseudoCode**: Understanding visual representations and algorithm design.
- **Time & Space Complexity of Recursive Algorithms**: Analyzing the efficiency of recursive algorithms.
- **Variables & DataTypes in C++**: Basics of C++ programming language.
- **Object Oriented Programming Concepts**: Understanding classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- **Operators, Conditionals & Loops**: Control flow mechanisms in programming.
- **Linked List**: Implementation and manipulation of linked lists.
- **Pattern Printing**: Solving problems related to pattern printing.
- **Stack & Queues**: Implementing and working with stack and queue data structures.
- **Function & in-depth Knowledge of flow**: Understanding functions and control flow.
- **Trees**: Understanding tree data structure and its applications.
- **Arrays - 1D & 2D**: Manipulating one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
- **Heaps**: Understanding heap data structure and its operations.
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Implementing dynamic arrays and their applications.
- **Hashing & Tries**: Working with hash tables and trie data structures.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementing and analyzing searching algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Understanding graph data structure and its algorithms.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing and analyzing sorting algorithms.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Solving problems using greedy approach.
- **Char Arrays & Strings**: Manipulating character arrays and strings.
- **Sliding Window Problems**: Solving problems using sliding window technique.
- **Basic Maths & Pointers**: Essential mathematical concepts and pointer manipulation.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Understanding dynamic programming paradigm.
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: Solving problems using recursion and backtracking techniques.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Manipulating bits for various operations.
- **Divide & Conquer Technique**: Understanding and implementing divide and conquer approach.

## Course Timeline

The course journey started on April 1st, coinciding with April Fool's Day. During this period, I diligently worked through the course curriculum, engaging with lectures, completing assignments, and practicing coding problems. 

This repository houses all the code implementations, notes, and additional resources that I gathered throughout this enriching learning experience. 

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository and witness my progression in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
